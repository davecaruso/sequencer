# dave's video automation system

This program helps automate rendering and importing media between different
software, eliminating the need for the user to manually handle intermediate
files. It also provides a basic NLE-style editor for sequencing media together,
making it a sort of "video editor that combines other video editors."

It is currently in a functional but highly experimental phase, and does not
support many features I want, including a GUI.
